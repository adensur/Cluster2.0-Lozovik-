Cluster2.0-Lozovik-
===================

This is a repo for my scientific work as a student of 6th year in Moscow's MIPT, for my professor Lozovik Yuriy Efremovich http://isan.troitsk.ru/ru/personal.php?pers_id=69

In this ReadMe file I will describe only the file structure in the repository.

In the main directory there will be:

Physics.odt - the main description of the scientific work of this repo; it describes the initial physical problem, briefly explains techniques used to research the problem, and presents results. ATM it is only available in russian.

Programming.odt - the description of the programming techniques used to achieve the results. ATM i am planning to write everything in R code, so this file will contain the code itself and the explanations for it.

The folder "R working directory" contains R files used for the science work:
-Cluster2.0.R contains the R code itself
-.RData is an environment for R which stores the variables and some functions, defined in the R console. This file is unnecessary.

Inside the "R working directory" folder there are also following folders: 
-data_init: contains pre-saved values of the initial coordinates of the particles in the system, corresponding to (presumably) potential energy minimum. (for the explanation look at Physics.odt file)
-Results folder contains specific results, obtained during modeling.
