Cluster2.0-Lozovik-
===================

This is a repo for my scientific work as a student of 6th year in Moscow's MIPT, for my professor Lozovik Yuriy Efremovich http://isan.troitsk.ru/ru/personal.php?pers_id=69

The description of what is going on is available in physics.docx file. Unfortunately, it is currently available only in Russian (I will probably provide translation later), and only in .docx format, because I needed the tool to edit formulae.

All the further data structure and R code explanations are included in physics.docx file.
This project is ongoing, so the description and the content will not always be synchronised!
