The physical system is defined by the following potential energy:
$$
U=\sum_{k=1}^{N}r_k^2+\sum_{i,k=1;i>k}^{N}\frac{1}{r_{ik}^6} (1)
$$
Here N is the number of particles in the system, $r_k=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ is the radius-vector of a paticle number *k* in 3-dimensional space;  $r_{ik}=\sqrt{(x_i-x_k)^2+(y_i-y_k)^2+(z_i-z_k)^2}$ is the distance between particles *i* and *k* in 3-dimensional space.


We want to find equilibrium states of such system, which means that we are to find the minimum of the potential energy (1)  
We are going to do that by assigning N random radius-vectors for the initial state of the system, and then performing gradient descent calculations to define the potential minimums.  
First let's write a function to initialize the random state of the system:
```{r}
init<-function(N){##initializes matrix 3 x N with correct rownames and random values
        r<-cbind(rnorm(N),rnorm(N),rnorm(N))
        colnames(r)<-(c("x","y","z"))
        r
}
init(5)
```
We can see now the result of initialization for N=5.
